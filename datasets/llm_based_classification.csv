We cannot wait the 18 months it might take.",‘Scores of trials are under way around the world.’,Complementarity,"The summary discusses the global hunt for a coronavirus drug and the use of AI. The caption provides additional, non-essential information by stating that numerous trials are underway, which supplements the summary's discussion of the drug search but isn't crucial for understanding the main point."
970,"Amazon warehouse workers are being told that Amazon workers are “the new Red Cross’ But we don’t want to be heroes. We are regular people. We shouldn’s be asked to risk our lives to come into work. And someone has to be held accountable for that, and that person is you. I have worked at Amazon for five years. Until I was fired last week from the Staten Island warehouse in New York City, I was a manager assistant who supervised a team of about 60-100 “pickers”, who pick items off the shelves.",Amazon workers stage a walkout at the company’s Staten Island warehouse.,Equivalence,"The summary discusses Amazon warehouse workers and the caption shows a walkout by Amazon workers at the Staten Island warehouse. Both texts directly refer to the same entity (Amazon workers) and the same location (Staten Island warehouse), indicating a token-token equivalence."
971,"No open data has been published alongside the evidence for the UK government’s coronavirus response. The Imperial College London model that prompted the current lockdown has still not been published as open-source code. Singapore has been publishing detailed data about every infected person, including their age, gender, workplace, where they have visited and whether they had contact with other infected people. The UK is making progress with regard to data: potential Covid-19 cases identified through online and call-centre triage are now being published daily.","‘Best practices are developing. Italy has been publishing open data daily, with regional breakdowns, and numbers of people self-isolating, hospitalised and in intensive care.’",Complementarity,"The caption provides an additional example ('Italy') to support the summary's point about data publication related to the coronavirus response. While the summary is understandable without the caption, the caption enriches the context by offering another instance of best practices."
972,"António Guterres: We must ensure a sufficiently global and coordinated response to the pandemic, then build resilience for the future. Only by coming together will the world be able to face down the Covid-19 pandemic and its shattering consequences. G20 leaders took steps in the right direction, but we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing. We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action based on science, solidarity and smart policies.","Fumigation in Sana’a, Yemen.",Complementarity,"The summary discusses António Guterres's call for a global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The caption shows fumigation efforts in Sana’a, Yemen, representing one specific local response to the pandemic and thus functioning as an adjunct providing a real-world example related to the broader discussion."
973,"Boris Johnson on 3 March published 28 pages of emergency plans, should coronavirus take hold in Britain. The experience of China through January was enough to put other countries on guard. Korea and Taiwan threw resources at testing, tracing and quarantining. Italy imposed increasingly severe lockdowns, followed by France, Denmark and Norway. The US did almost nothing; Russia and many African nations likewise. Everywhere people were told to “listen to the science’. But “the science” appeared to lead us to differing conclusions.","‘The first intimation that Britain was getting serious came with the first of Johnson’s daily press conferences.’ Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson and Patrick Vallance at a coronavirus press conference in London, 16 March 2020.",Complementarity,"The summary describes Boris Johnson's initial response to the coronavirus pandemic. The caption provides a specific instance of Johnson addressing the public during a press conference related to the pandemic, adding context and detail to the summary's broader overview, but is not essential to understanding the initial response."
974,"Shadow chancellor calls for wealth tax to pay for coronavirus measures. He says we must plan for a future based on solidarity and quality of life. Even the most diehard Tory neoliberal free marketeer would acknowledge that if the crisis has taught us anything, it is that anything is possible. Austerity never worked in tackling the impact of the banking crisis and it won’t work in addressing the consequences of the coronav virus crisis. Plus we have the greatest crisis of all facing us: the existential threat to human existence from the climate crisis.",Volunteers at a Trussell Trust food bank in Oldham.,Complementarity,"The summary discusses the shadow chancellor's call for a wealth tax and a future based on solidarity. The caption shows volunteers at a food bank, which provides a concrete example related to the theme of solidarity and addressing societal needs, but isn't essential to understanding the main point of the summary. It functions as supplementary context."
975,"There is no right or wrong way for governments to deal with the financial impact of coronavirus - only trade-offs. It is almost certain that 2020 will be a recession year in every advanced economy. Most affected countries have by now adopted strict lockdown measures. The IMF lists sizeable emergency policies for more than a hundred countries, almost all adopted in the past few weeks. The first priority of these policies should be to support the health sector, quickly increasing the capacity of beds, staff and ventilators.",A Copenhagen street: ‘Denmark is paying firms up to 90% of their wage bill.’,Complementarity,"The summary discusses the financial impact of coronavirus and government responses, while the caption provides a specific example of Denmark's approach. This adds supplementary context to the general discussion in the summary, but is not essential to understanding the core message."
976,"There is a lack of good, robust evidence on the effectiveness of standard face masks worn by the public. We don’t even have good, case-controlled studies about how effective face masks are at preventing the spread of influenza, which is the model for respiratory virus diseases. The last thing we want is people neglecting the measures we know definitely work, such as washing hands, keeping surfaces clean and maintaining distance from other people. The World Health Organization will take some of the many factors into account when it considers recommendations about face masks.","A woman in St Paul’s, Bristol, wearing a face mask.",Complementarity,"The summary discusses the effectiveness of face masks in general, while the caption provides a specific example of a woman wearing a face mask. The caption enriches the context by illustrating mask usage but isn't essential to understanding the summary's main point about the lack of evidence supporting their effectiveness."
977,"Jared Kushner reportedly told the president that Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, was being ‘alarmist’ after he announced that his state required 30,000 ventilators to help get through the pandemic. The princeling has helped place American lives and bodies on the line, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: If the Trump Organization can bill the Secret Service when they guard the president at his personal properties, why can’t the Kushner kids make a few dimes off the taxpayer?",The White House adviser Jared Kushner listens during a teleconference with governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters on 19 March.,Equivalence,"The summary refers to Jared Kushner's actions and opinions. The caption shows Jared Kushner in a relevant context (a teleconference at FEMA), establishing a direct link through the identical entity, ""Jared Kushner."""
978,"The US is now the new centre of the pandemic, with more than a fifth of the million cases reported worldwide, and more than 5,000 deaths. The richest country in the world is structurally ill-equipped to cope with such a crisis. The lack of universal healthcare or basic employment rights such as statutory sick pay, and the low incomes on which so many Americans survive, are conducive to the spread of disease. An utter failure of leadership – the lack of will, intelligence, basic competence or even consistency on the part of the Trump administration – has turbocharged the problem.","‘An utter failure of leadership – the lack of will, intelligence, basic competence or even consistency on the part of the Trump administration – has turbocharged the problem.’",Equivalence,"The caption contains a direct quote from the summary. The tokens within the quote are identical in both texts, indicating a literal, exact match."
979,"The Morrison government has doubled the dole one day, effectively part-nationalising private sector payrolls the next. It might seem they have abandoned every economic principle they once held sacred. But as Malcolm Farr wrote this week, the prime minister sees it as a temporary transformation of practical necessity. The country will be deeply in debt, as will many households. And when the stimulus spending is turned off, as it must be, we’ll face fundamental choices about how we reassemble the pieces – of our economy and our society and our freedoms.","Scott Morrison’s government has done a complete ideological about-face, but don’t expect that to last when normality returns.",Equivalence,"The summary refers to the ""Morrison government"" and its economic actions. The caption explicitly mentions ""Scott Morrison's government"", indicating a direct match between the entity discussed in both texts using unambiguous tokens."
980,"Pirouz Hanachi is the mayor of Tehran, Iran. He has seen lives lost as a result of medical shortages. This is no time for vindictive politics, he says. The world cannot go on like this. If global leaders fail to seize the opportunity to embrace change, we will all continue to remain highly vulnerable to communicable diseases, environmental catastrophes, global warming, terrorism, violent extremism and other shared threats. He says: 'No town, city or nation can be indifferent to global crises'","A temporary hospital for coronavirus patients at an exhibition centre in Tehran, Iran: ‘As a result of US sanctions, Iran’s ability to provide the health, logistical and other essential infrastructure necessary to combat the disease has been drastically reduced.’",Complementarity,"The summary describes Pirouz Hanachi's statements about global crises and the need for change, while the caption shows a temporary hospital in Tehran, Iran. The caption provides context about the situation in Tehran due to US sanctions, which is supplementary to Hanachi's general message but not essential for understanding it."
981,"Chaos in response to Covid-19 is no surprise. Nor is the unscrupulous operators’ pursuit of profit and political advantage. The utter chaos in America’s response to the coronavirus pandemic is tailor-made for Donald Trump, who has spent a lifetime exploiting chaos for personal gain and blaming others for losses. Trump has told governors to find life-saving equipment on their own. He refuses to create a central bargaining agent, arguing the federal government is “not a shipping clerk’",Donald Trump speaks at the White House on Saturday.,Equivalence,"The summary and the caption both explicitly mention 'Donald Trump'. The caption shows Donald Trump in an image, while the summary discusses his actions and role in the Covid-19 response."
982,"Even people without symptoms can infect other just by speaking but a simple cloth covering can stop us spreading harmful droplets. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus. The WHO recommends only wearing a mask if you are sick, or looking after somebody who is sick. Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. In South Korea, the government stepped in until late February and ensured a supply for every person in the country.",A woman wearing a face mask stands on the Charles Bridge in Prague. Mask use went from 0% to nearly 100% in three days after a social media and influencer campaign.,Complementarity,"The summary discusses the importance of precautions like mask-wearing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The caption provides a specific example of mask usage in Prague, offering additional context and illustrating the summary's point but is not essential to understanding the core message about preventative measures."
983,"In times of crisis, scientists have to make ethical decisions about new treatments – even if the evidence seems shaky. In 1918, in the midst of the worst flu pandemic in history, doctors all over the world prescribed quinine, another anti-malarial drug, even though there was no evidence that it worked for flu. In an ideal world, the scientists would furnish the facts and the politicians would weigh them against other facts and make decisions. The politicians would shoulder the ethical burden. But we don’t live in an Ideal world, and that division of labour is an illusion.","A queue in San Francisco during the Spanish flu epidemic, 1918.",Equivalence,"The summary discusses the 1918 flu pandemic and the ethical decisions made by scientists and politicians during that time. The caption depicts a queue in San Francisco during the same pandemic. Thus, both texts point to elements within the same historical event and context."
984,"Frida Ghitis: The oil industry saw its opening and moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of this moment. She says it combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. Ghitis says the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can’t make themselves heard. The pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the financing and permits.",TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline facility.,Equivalence,"The summary refers to ""The pipeline"", while the caption identifies a specific instance of that type of pipeline, namely ""TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline facility."" This is a case of class versus instance, where the summary mentions a general type, and the caption shows a specific example."
985,"Everyone is learning how to live, how to work (where possible and necessary) and simply how to be during this extraordinary and troubling era of Covid-19. With most staff working remotely, the highly collaborative task of journalism has been atomised and reshaped via new ways of liaising and rapid innovation around editorial technology. Some readers have urged the removal of coronavirus articles that are overtaken by events. The Guardian’s policy is not to take down articles other than in the most exceptional circumstances. During a public health crisis, a responsibility to reader safety is essential.",‘A new series called Hope in a time of crisis responds to this shared feeling with doses of positive news.’ Jason Baird dressed as Spider-Man entertain children in lockdown in Stockport.,Complementarity,"The summary discusses the Guardian's approach to covering the Covid-19 pandemic and their policy on not removing articles. The caption provides an example of positive news during the crisis, offering supplementary context by illustrating a specific act of hope and positivity, but it is not essential to understanding the Guardian's policy."
986,"If Europe, the US and China are struggling to contain it, what chance for millions of people in less developed countries? It is a terrible thing to see a disaster in the making and be unable to prevent it. The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world’s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. Many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition. People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable.","Dhaka, Bangladesh… ‘how impossible are the concepts of social distancing and self-isolation.’",Complementarity,"The summary discusses the vulnerability of less developed countries to health crises. The caption provides a specific example (Dhaka, Bangladesh) illustrating the challenges of implementing preventative measures like social distancing, adding context but not being essential to understanding the summary's core message."
987,"In the slums of Delhi or Lagos, social distancing is a dream while social exclusion is all too real and pernicious. ‘The virus does not discriminate,’ suggested Michael Gove after both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were struck down by Covid-19. But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared. We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off.","Disease stalked the floating slum of Makoko in Lagos, Nigeria, long before the coronavirus crisis.",Complementarity,"The summary discusses the impact of COVID-19 on slums and social inequality. The caption provides specific context by naming a slum in Lagos and mentioning that disease was present there even before the pandemic, adding supplementary context but not changing the core argument of the summary."
988,"Last week, more than six million people applied for unemployment, the largest jump in unemployment claims in our country’s history. The Federal Reserve estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to 47 million Americans losing their jobs in the weeks to come. Radically expanding federal employment to put these displaced workers to work is in the interest of our national security, writes Julian Zelizer.

989,"Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19, the UK has tested just 152,979 people for the Corona virus. The UK’s health minister, Matt Hancock, didn’t mention Landt, but he was quick to point to the strength of the German pharmaceutical industry as the primary reason for the country's aggressive testing regime. The four million tests produced by Landt's company have been distributed throughout the world. Germany captured 4.01% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2016, whereas the US controlled 44.45% of the market in the same year.","‘Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19.’ Fast tests for coronavirus, developed by Frankfurt’s University Clinic and the German Red Cross.",Equivalence,"The summary and caption both explicitly state that Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19.

Both texts use the identical tokens to refer to the same individual, satisfying the Token-Token equivalence."
991,"Pall Thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. He explains why soap works so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and indeed most viruses. The virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and dies – or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.",‘Soap dissolves the fat membrane of the virus – and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and dies.’,Equivalence,"The caption directly quotes a key explanation from the summary regarding how soap inactivates the virus. Both texts share identical phrasing, indicating a direct match of information."
992,"The stated aim has been to achieve ‘herd immunity’ in order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophic ‘second wave’ next winter. A large proportion of the population is at lower risk of developing severe disease: roughly speaking anyone up to the age of 40. We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die. And the mortality rate will climb when the NHS is overwhelmed.","Patients in a temporary overflow building at Brescia hospital, Italy. ‘In Italy, the choices of whom to save and whom to allow to die are real.’",Complementarity,"The summary discusses the concept of herd immunity and potential consequences of the pandemic. The caption provides a real-world example of the strain on healthcare systems, specifically in Italy, which complements the summary's discussion about the NHS being overwhelmed, but it is not essential for understanding the summary."
993,"The writer is an NHS consultant who works across a number of hospitals. He says he has been blindsided by the speed at which the hypothetical became the real and then the rapidly obsolete. People are frightened in a way that he has not seen before, he says. But despite all of this we are still here and I have true faith in my colleagues and I take heart from their calm determination and courage, he writes. Comments on this piece are premated to ensure there is discussion on topics raised by the writer.",A doctor and patient in a hospital in Wales.,Complementarity,"The summary describes a writer's experience as an NHS consultant during a challenging time. The caption provides a visual context by showing a doctor and patient in a hospital setting, which is supplementary but not essential to understanding the writer's message."
994,"Dominic Cummings loves to theorise about complexity, but he’s getting it all wrong. The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with ‘scientism’ – things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake. So we have wasted weeks and weeks of safety-prone computer codes that have wasted thousands of lives.","Crowds of shoppers in Edinburgh, 2 March 2020: ‘Herd immunity was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the ‘just do nothing’ approach.’",Complementarity,"The caption adds context to the summary by providing a specific example related to the 'herd immunity' concept mentioned. While the summary critiques the UK's approach to complexity and policymaking, the caption offers a concrete illustration of one aspect of that approach."
995,"In a lockdown, we can see the essence of politics is still what Hobbes described: some people get to tell others what to do. At the heart of all modern politics is a trade-off between personal liberty and collective choice. The government is doing all it can to dress up its decisions in the language of commonsense advice. But as the experience of other European countries shows, as the crisis deepens the stark realities become clearer. National governments really matter, and it really matters which one you happen to find yourself under.",No Caption,Independence,"The summary discusses the essence of politics during a lockdown, focusing on the trade-off between liberty and collective choice. The caption provides no information, suggesting that the summary stands alone and doesn't depend on the image caption for its meaning. Therefore, they are thematically grouped but independent."
996,"CEOs, billionaires and advisers have the president’s ear and want people back to work. Dick Kovacevich, former CEO of Wells Fargo bank, thinks most Americans should return to work in April. Tom Galisano, the founder of Paychex, believes “the damages of keeping the economy closed could be worse than losing a few more people”, Donald Trump is concerned that a prolonged lockdown might harm his chances of re-election.

However, the image is not essential to understanding the summary's main points about the opinions of CEOs and the severity of the pandemic."
997,"This pandemic is throwing into stark relief a treacherous fact: we depend on employment, both for survival and a sense of self. Across the world, numerous industries have entered a state of suspended animation, imposing a sharp and involuntary brake on the working lives of millions of people. My interest in the question of how to live without work lead me to write a book on the topic. I discussed clinical cases, as well as lives of major artists and thinkers, that spoke to the importance of renewing contact with our neglected inner lives and letting our minds roam without the imperatives of productivity or purpose dogging every moment.",‘The virus is throwing into stark relief an obvious yet suddenly treacherous fact of life today: we depend on work.’ A composite photograph showing signs on shop fronts at Streatham High Road in south London,Equivalence,"The summary and caption both refer to the impact of the pandemic.

998,"People assume that we’re vulnerable to false information. But even in times of crisis, common sense usually prevails. Covid-19 can be cured by ingesting fish-tank cleaning products. Coronavirus was developed in Chinese (or American, or French) labs. Cristiano Ronaldo and the pope tested positive. Why does misinformation flourish? In many cases, people share fake news for fun. We are titillated by gross stories (it all started with bat soup) and celebrity gossip.","‘Believing that Cristiano Ronaldo (above) has been infected, or that the virus came from a failed biological experiment isn’t all that consequential.’",Equivalence,"The summary discusses misinformation surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo testing positive for COVID-19. The caption directly references the same misinformation about Cristiano Ronaldo being infected, indicating a literal equivalence through identical tokens."
999,"The rich and famous are desperate to prove we are all in this together. But the outbreak has highlighted just how false that is. Would you spare a thought for all the poor, suffering celebrities out there? While this is a difficult time for everyone, it has been particularly tough on the famous. They have been upstaged by a virus. No one cares what they are wearing or who they are snogging any more. It seems as if some celebrities are starting to grapple with the realisation that they are not quite as important as they thought they were.","Pushing the boat out ... David Geffen’s $590m superyacht, Rising Sun.",Complementarity,"The summary discusses the struggles of celebrities during a time when public attention is diverted by a global health crisis.

1006,"Analysts say plunging demand for oil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic combined with a savage price war has left the fossil fuel industry broken and in survival mode. It faces the gravest challenge in its 100-year history, they say, one that will permanently alter the industry. Some oil major stock market valuations halved since January. At least two-thirds of annual investment – $130bn – dumped and tens of thousands of job losses.

1008,"Dirty air is known to cause lung and heart damage and is responsible for at least 8m early deaths a year. This underlying health damage means respiratory infections, such as coronavirus, may well have a more serious impact on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes. But strict confinement measures in China and Italy have led to falls in air pollution as fewer vehicles are driven and industrial emissions fall. A US expert suggests that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution may have been avoided by the cleaner air in China.",Traffic congestion in London. City dwellers may be more susceptible to to the coronavirus because of air pollution levels.,Complementarity,"The caption provides an example (traffic congestion in London) that illustrates the concept of air pollution mentioned in the summary.

1009,"Satellite images reveal marked fall in global nitrogen dioxide levels. Levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year. Nitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma. One expert said the sudden shift represented the ‘largest scale experiment ever’ in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.
