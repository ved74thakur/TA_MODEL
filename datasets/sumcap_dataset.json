Instead, you can try this quick Irish bread. It\u2019s known as soda bread in most places, but in Northern Ireland (where I\u2019m from) soda bread is very different so this is usually called wheaten bread. The whole process takes less than an hour. It uses wholewheat flour traditionally but if you really can\u2019t find wholeWheat, it will still work with just plain flour.",

The number of COVID-19 cases, currently at 5,350, will only continue rising if people don't stay in their homes with far stricter restrictions.

If stricter rules were brought in, schools would likely be shutdown, as would all takeaways, with only essential stores open - such as supermarkets and pharmacies.",

About 100,000 people could be infected with the new coronavirus around the world, experts have warned. Labour called on the government to reassure the public that the NHS could cope with an outbreak when it is already struggling with the winter flu season. So far there are around 40 cases outside China, including three each in the United States and France. All 56 deaths have occurred in China, mostly in people who were older and had underlying health problems that made it hard to fight off the virus.",

But once deaths outside hospital - including at home - are taken in the number rises to 210, new figures from the Office of National Statistics show. 181 people die in the week up toMarch 20 alone. That means more than 70 per cent of total deaths occurred in that week, which is a huge spike. Yesterday the Department of Health reported 1,408 deaths in the UK but these numbers only include those who have died in NHS hospitals.",

Kim is believed to have recalled the fleet and anchored it off the coast in bid to stop the spread of Covid-19. Satellite photos suggest some the ships may still have their crews still on board in an enforced quarantine at sea. Experts said the new measures are likely a reaction to the global outbreak of the coronavirus. Almost 800,000 people have been confirmed infected worldwide, with nearly 38,000 deaths. It is feared Kim\u2019s regime lacks even basic medicines and equipment to treat the country's 25 million citizens.",
